## Visibility of System Status
- system provides loading feedback when uploading files into the portal
- top bar and side bar buttons change colors/underlined when hover overed
- provides status of forms filled and appointments made

## Match Between System and the Real World
- when making appointments in the portal, the use of compicated medical terminology made it confusing to choose the correct reason for the appointment (3)
- the "How do I" downbar is essentially a FAQ but it isn't immediately obvious (1)

## User Control and Freedom
- there is no back button for navigating through appointments, the cancel button immediately brings you back to the main page of the portal (3)
- portal provides opportunities to make, cancel, and reschedule appointments

## Consistency and Standards
- some pages use the same font colors to denote words to emphasize but also as headings (1)
- the way information is provided is inconsistent because sometimes it is an image with colors and words, and other times it is a big block of text (2)
- font sizes for sister pages inconsistent (1)
- method of emphasizing information inconsistent and confusing, could be red, bold, blue, larger font, etc (2)
